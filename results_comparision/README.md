# HSI-SR-GDRRN: Reconstrction Results Comparison
Single Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Grouped Deep Recursive Residual Network

# Generating HSIs resonstruction results of Bicubic and Bilinear

- Bicubic: run 'demo_bicubic.m' using matlab.
- Bilinear: run 'demo_bilinear.m' using matlab.

# Reconstrction Results Comparison

- To compare these methods, please run 'demo.m', which will search all test results in '../results/'. Results whose training epoch is less than 30 will be ignored because their testing is unfinished.
